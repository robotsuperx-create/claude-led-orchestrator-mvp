# AO CLI Catalog

`ao` is a thin CLI over the local AO daemon. Every command is `ao <command> --help` for the authoritative flag list.

| Command | What it does | When to use | Details |
|---|---|---|---|
| `spawn` | Spawn a project worker, orchestrator, or projectless standalone worker | Starting a new task or issue | [commands/spawn.md](commands/spawn.md) |
| `session` | Manage agent sessions (list, kill, rename, restore, etc.) | Inspecting or controlling running/terminated sessions | [commands/session.md](commands/session.md) |
| `agent` | Inspect installed harnesses and launch readiness | Choosing or diagnosing an agent harness | `ao agent ls --refresh` |
| `pr` | Merge a PR or resolve its review threads | Completing a reviewed change | `ao pr merge` / `ao pr resolve-comments` |
| `project` | Register, inspect, configure, or remove projects | Setting up or managing repos AO knows about | [commands/project.md](commands/project.md) |
| `automation` | Manage durable recurring session automations | Creating, editing, disabling, deleting, and inspecting scheduled runs | [commands/automation.md](commands/automation.md) |
| `cue` | Create or list reusable project Cues | Saving a repetitive command or agent task at the user's request | [commands/cue.md](commands/cue.md) |
| `orchestrator` | List orchestrator sessions | Viewing which sessions are orchestrators | [commands/orchestrator.md](commands/orchestrator.md) |
| `review` | List, submit, cancel, or trigger a reviewer pass for a worker's PR | Managing a code review loop | [commands/review.md](commands/review.md) |
| `send` | Send a message to a running agent session | Correcting or directing a live agent | [commands/send.md](commands/send.md) |
| `report` | Persist a meaningful worker report | Checkpoints, blockers, decisions, outputs, and completion | [commands/report.md](commands/report.md) |
| `preview` | Start a session-owned app or open an exact URL/file | Running and showing the worker's relevant app, Markdown, HTML, PDF, or image | [commands/preview.md](commands/preview.md) |
| `browser` | Inspect and control the session's shared live browser | Verifying a web app through snapshots, interactions, waits, screenshots, console, and errors | [commands/browser.md](commands/browser.md) |
| `start` | Fetch (if needed) and open the AO desktop app | Launching the app | [commands/start.md](commands/start.md) |
| `stop` | Stop the AO daemon | Shutting down AO | [commands/stop.md](commands/stop.md) |
| `status` | Show daemon status | Verifying the daemon is up and healthy | [commands/status.md](commands/status.md) |
| `doctor` | Run local health checks | Diagnosing AO setup problems | [commands/doctor.md](commands/doctor.md) |
| `import` | Import projects from a legacy AO install | Migrating from the old flat-file store | [commands/import.md](commands/import.md) |

## Conventions

- Most read commands accept `--json` for machine-readable output.
- `-p / --project` scopes session subcommand lookups to one project.
- Session and project ids are shown by `ao session ls` and `ao project ls`.
- To refer to a session in AO Chat or the AO terminal, use the canonical in-app
  link `ao://sessions/{project-id}/{session-id}`. Read
  [commands/session.md](commands/session.md) for identity, encoding, and safety
  rules before constructing one.
- When the user asks to save a repeatable task as a Cue, use `ao cue list --json` to check existing definitions, then `ao cue create`. An agent Cue stores a reusable instruction; a command Cue stores an exact shell command. This agent-facing command can create and read Cues, but cannot edit or delete them. Direct the user to project settings for changes to existing Cues.
- `--agent` is an alias for `--harness` on `ao spawn`.
- Every command accepts `-h / --help` for the full flag list.
- For frontend launch, preview selection, or artifact handoff, read
  [commands/preview.md](commands/preview.md) before acting. Its static-file,
  project-runtime, and automatic-handoff rules are load-bearing.
- For page inspection, interaction, or request diagnosis, read
  [commands/browser.md](commands/browser.md). It defines shared-tab behavior
  and the opt-in network policy.

Use [references.md](references.md) only when a natural-language request does
not map clearly to a command above.
