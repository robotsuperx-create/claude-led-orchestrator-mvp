// Package agentcreds validates coding-agent credentials against the provider
// that will actually be asked to honor them.
//
// The problem it exists to solve is that every local check answers "is a
// credential configured?" and reports it as "is the user authenticated?".
// Those are different questions. Validity is a server-side fact: a credential
// can be revoked, downgraded, or rate-limited with no change on disk, so only
// a network call can observe it.
//
// The package is shared by the desktop daemon and Cloud, which resolve
// credentials in opposite directions. Cloud is handed a secret explicitly and
// its hard problem is custody; the daemon discovers a secret locally and its
// hard problem is resolution — deciding which of several sources wins. Only
// the second half, the probe, is common to both, so that is what lives here:
// resolution is the caller's business, classification is ours.
//
// Three rules hold throughout.
//
// A verdict is three-state. "Invalid" requires the provider to have rejected a
// well-formed credential; everything else that goes wrong — a timeout, a
// malformed request, an endpoint that does not exist — is Unknown. A false
// negative locks out a working user and is strictly worse than the false
// positive of staying quiet.
//
// The header follows the credential's Kind and is never guessed. A token sent
// under the wrong header is rejected for the wrong reason, and the rejection
// is indistinguishable from a revoked credential.
//
// Every supported probe hits a model-listing endpoint, never a generic
// identity endpoint. Providers without a documented, non-billable validation
// contract are recognized but remain unknown until the runtime contacts them.
