 * later turn failing for a reason that looks generic. A thread the provider has put
 * into `system_error` looks, from AO's side, like an agent that has gone quiet.
 *
 * They live above the scroller rather than in it because they are current state:
 * scrolling away from them must not scroll away from the reason the session is
