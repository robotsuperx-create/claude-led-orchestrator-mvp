/**
 * Renderer-side construction of the cloud control-plane client.
 *
 * The control plane has no CORS and the WorkOS bearer token lives only in the
 * Electron main process, so requests are proxied over the preload `cloudCp`
 * bridge when it is present (main attaches the real token; any Authorization
 * header set renderer-side is replaced). The bridge surface is being built in
 * parallel, so it is reached via optional `window` access rather than a
 * compile-time import. Without a bridge (browser dev preview) calls fall back
 * to `window.fetch`, where no credential is available and the control plane
 * answers 401 — the same terminal state as being signed out.
