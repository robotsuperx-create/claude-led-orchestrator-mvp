# Documentation coverage

Reviewed 4 October 2026. The public desktop guide uses [v0.13.3](https://github.com/Untrivial-ai/agent-orchestrator/releases/tag/v0.13.3), published 1 October 2026 UTC. The original source checks used PR #6166 at `44c6ca8a1f8a9492101f6928033fa7aa830b162f`. The 4 October follow-up checked `f8a8416c5` and incorporated main at `b2461dc59`. The follow-up changes edit documentation, not product behavior. Contributor guides describe that checkout. Cloud availability also depends on the deployed service and the signed-in account.

## What was checked

## Local verification

The follow-up passed the production docs build, including its TypeScript check. The export contains 50 HTML pages for 47 public content routes. All 1,499 internal links and anchors resolved. The export preserves content anchors from both the pre-PR manual and the previous PR export, including three restored historical anchors. A separate check found no missing targets among 217 relative links in changed repository Markdown files.

Both backend and Cloud embedded skill-asset test packages passed. `git diff --check` passed. The mobile package passed a clean dependency install, TypeScript check, and all 1,498 tests across 161 files on Node 20. The revised feedback guide rendered in the local browser preview, had no horizontal overflow at 390 pixels, and produced no captured browser console errors. Native product screenshots and the acceptance tests listed below remain open. `ao preview` could not run because this Codex chat has no `AO_SESSION_ID`; the docs preview used the in-app browser directly.

The public mobile guide uses stable **Pair Desktop** and identifies **Pair a machine** in newer builds. It records the current Tailscale setup limitation. Real-device pairing and secure remote access remain unverified.

The full local backend race run reported failures in unchanged runtime and authentication tests, including command-probe timeouts. It did not establish a passing full suite. Native OS jobs, container checks, and the remaining CI checks require separate results; the successful documentation and mobile checks do not cover them.

## 4 October corrections

The follow-up resolved the architecture merge conflict by retaining main's new
conversation-authentication section and the reviewed heading. It corrected
Cloud terminal wake and lease behavior, live relay input, and read/operate
permissions against the handlers and storage methods. Public instructions now
use the Cloud harness login controls, distinguish CLI startup and diagnostics
from daemon-backed commands, and explain the embedded Unreal Agent exception.
The old `shipped-terminal-harnesses` anchor remains available.

The production docs build and its TypeScript check passed again. All 1,499
internal links resolved, with no lost content anchors or removed pages. The
revised catalog rendered in the browser with no captured console warnings or
errors. The local commit hook completed its full backend test command with
failures in unchanged authentication, probe-timing, Git-default, and importer
tests. That run is recorded as failed, not as a passing full validation.

The Cloud client passed generation, type checking, all 26 tests, and its build.
The Cloud contract now describes the reviewed personal credential and wake
routes. It is still a partial API inventory. Issue #6220 tracks the remaining
route groups and a coverage check; generating client types alone does not prove
that every server route is represented.

## Local reader preview

The final wording pass makes the built-in Unreal Agent exception consistent in
Installation, Quickstart, and Built-in capabilities. Connect Mobile starts with
pairing, puts protocol details below the steps, and explains the iPhone Tailscale
limitation before setup advice. Cloud archive and restore instructions are
separate actions. Both guides keep their testing limitations in expandable notes.

The production docs build and TypeScript check passed after these edits. All
1,499 internal links resolved. No pages or existing section anchors were lost,
including those in the previous PR export. The mobile and Cloud pages rendered
at a 397-pixel browser width without horizontal overflow or captured console
warnings or errors. The mobile verification note expanded successfully. These
are documentation-preview checks, not native mobile or Cloud acceptance tests.

## Homebrew verification

The existing [AgentWrapper tap](https://github.com/AgentWrapper/homebrew-tap/blob/main/Casks/agent-orchestrator.rb) contains version `0.13.3`. Its arm64 and x64 SHA-256 values match the corresponding official release assets. The old GitHub release URL redirects to `Untrivial-ai/agent-orchestrator` and returned HTTP 200. A new tap name is not needed for this documentation change.

The cask declares `auto_updates true`; AO's in-app updater remains the normal update path. The optional Homebrew commands follow the [Homebrew upgrade documentation](https://docs.brew.sh/Manpage). This review did not install, upgrade, or remove the user's app through Homebrew.

## Open acceptance work

| Follow-up | Status | Evidence needed to close it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [#6178: Mobile walkthrough](https://github.com/Untrivial-ai/agent-orchestrator/issues/6178) | Open | Real iOS and Android pairing on LAN and secure remote access; off-Wi-Fi reconnect; sleep, push, removal, rotation, and version-mismatch checks; screenshots without credentials |
| [#6179: Cloud walkthrough and limits](https://github.com/Untrivial-ai/agent-orchestrator/issues/6179) | Open | Authorized account journey through sign-in, repository/provider setup, task, files, terminal, review, Archive/Restore; deployed release and account-specific costs/limits |
| [#6180: Landing-page coverage](https://github.com/Untrivial-ai/agent-orchestrator/issues/6180) | Open in the public repository for coordination | Companion change in the website's owning repository and a check of deployed copy and links |
| [#6220: Cloud API route coverage](https://github.com/Untrivial-ai/agent-orchestrator/issues/6220) | Open | Reconcile the remaining public and worker routes with OpenAPI, regenerate types, and record intentional exclusions |
| [#6169: Unknown CLI configuration keys](https://github.com/Untrivial-ai/agent-orchestrator/issues/6169) | Open product fix | CLI rejects unsupported JSON keys before replacing configuration |
| [#5954: CLI effort preservation](https://github.com/Untrivial-ai/agent-orchestrator/issues/5954) | Open product fix | CLI input and output preserve `agentConfig.effort` |

A public Cloud health response was reported as HTTP 200 on 3 October 2026 in the PR's earlier verification. It does not prove an authenticated user journey. The isolated desktop can run locally, but native screen capture failed during this follow-up; product walkthrough screenshots remain pending. No pairing credential was generated or captured.

Keep these rows open until their results are recorded. A source check, successful build, or readable guide cannot substitute for a real-device or authenticated-service test.
