# Documentation map

This repository is edited by humans and by coding agents. Both need to know two
things quickly: which document describes a given concern, and which artifact is
the **source of truth** for it when documents disagree.

AO's documentation has two layers. They grew organically; this page names them
so the split is intentional rather than incidental.

| Layer                     | Audience                      | Examples                                                        | How it stays correct                                    |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| Human-facing docs         | Contributors, users           | `README.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/`, https://docs.orchestrator.inc | Review. Prose describes code; it can lag behind it.     |
| Machine-readable contract | Coding agents, CI, generators | `openapi.yaml`, `AGENTS.md`, `skills/`, sqlc `gen/`             | Generated from source and/or checked by CI drift gates. |

The rule of thumb: **if an artifact in the contract layer disagrees with prose,
generated contracts and their source win** for implemented behavior. Handwritten
operating rules and skills still need comparison with current code and tests;
being listed in the contract layer does not make their prose drift-proof.

| [frontend/src/docs/content/](../frontend/src/docs/content/)  | MDX sources for the public manual; `meta.json` files preserve navigation and order. |

These documents explain intent and rationale. They are reviewed by people and
are not machine-checked, so treat them as the _why_ and confirm the _what_
against the contract layer below.

For capability claims, compare the worker, Chat-driver, and reviewer registries
separately. For user flows, check the renderer and daemon wiring as well as
DTOs. The public manual uses the latest stable desktop release as its user
baseline: **v0.13.3, published 1 October 2026 UTC** at the time of this review.
Contributor docs such as `docs/STATUS.md` describe the checked-out revision of
`main`, which can be ahead of that release. Gated Cloud behavior needs a
separate deployed-environment check; source and a healthy public endpoint do
not prove an authenticated user journey. The [coverage checklist](documentation-coverage.md)
records those limits and any post-release differences.

The CLI's hand-mirrored DTOs (`backend/internal/cli/`) are a deliberate manual
boundary: they are not generated from `openapi.yaml`, and wire compatibility is
covered by tests rather than a generator. See "API contract changes" in
[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).

## How to keep the layers in sync

- **Changing the daemon API**: edit `dto.go` and `build.go`, run `npm run api`,
  commit `openapi.yaml` and `schema.ts` with the Go change. CI fails otherwise.
- **Changing storage**: edit queries or add a migration, run `npm run sqlc`,
  commit `gen/`. Never hand-edit `gen/` or already-merged migrations.
- **Changing a hard rule or boundary**: update `AGENTS.md` in the same PR, and
  add an ADR under `docs/adr/` when the rule is a decision that needs rationale.
- **Changing `ao` CLI behavior**: update the command, its table test, and the
  matching page under `backend/internal/skillassets/using-ao/commands/`.
- **Changing prose only**: fine, but if the prose describes a contract artifact,
  re-read that artifact first. Prose follows the contract, not the reverse.

## Where to add new documentation

- A user needs it to use the product: https://docs.orchestrator.inc (source under
  `frontend/src/docs/content/`).
- A contributor needs it to change the code: `docs/`, and add a row to
  [docs/README.md](README.md).
- An agent needs it to operate safely in the repo: `AGENTS.md`.
- An agent needs it to use the `ao` CLI at runtime: `backend/internal/skillassets/using-ao/`.
- It is a decision with trade-offs: `docs/adr/`.
