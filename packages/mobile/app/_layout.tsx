// Android needs **two** detents to do that, which is not a styling preference:
// react-native-screens only expands a sheet for the IME when it has more than
// one detent. See `SheetDelegate.configureBottomSheetBehaviour`, `KeyboardVisible`
// branch — with 2 or 3 detents it calls `useTwoDetents(STATE_EXPANDED)`, but with
// a single detent (which is what `fitToContents` compiles to) it only attaches a
// callback and leaves the height alone. That is why this sheet sat behind the
// keyboard: a one-detent sheet structurally cannot get out of its way.
//
// So Android opens at the smaller detent and is expanded to the larger one by the
// OS as soon as a field is focused, then restored when the keyboard hides. iOS
// lifts a presented sheet by itself, so it keeps the exact-fit sizing.
