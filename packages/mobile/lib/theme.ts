// Mission Control palette. Color = meaning; most states get none.
//
//   neutral (accent) = interactive emphasis: primary actions, selected controls
//   orange           = a working agent (alive, running)
//   amber            = needs your input / attention
//   red              = failing / stuck / crashed
//   green            = mergeable / passed / approved
//   purple           = merged
//   neutral (muted)  = terminal states — done, killed
//
// Purple was added for merged, which was the one state that needed its own hue:
// it borrowed the muted grey shared with "done" and "killed", so a pull request
// that landed looked like a session that had merely switched off, sitting next
// to a green that had only just said "mergeable". Purple means exactly that one
// thing and nothing else.
//
// Blue is still absent. Every remaining hue means a state, so the interactive
// accent carries emphasis with contrast — a filled pill against a hairline
// outline — instead
// of with a hue of its own. That keeps exactly one meaning per color, and stops
// a filled button from reading as a status.
//
// The terminal's ANSI ramp further down is the one exception: a terminal's 16
// colors are a compatibility surface owned by the agent TUIs, not part of this
// palette, and agents print in them by name.
//
// Two palettes of one shape. Light is derived from the desktop app's
// frontend/src/styles/tokens.css `:root[data-theme="light"]` block, with two
// deliberate departures:
//
//  1. Surfaces follow the iOS grouped-list convention — a grey base with white
//     cards — rather than desktop's near-white-on-white, which relies on borders
//     that are much harder to see on a phone.
//  2. Semantic colours are DARKENED for light mode, not reused. A hue tuned for
//     contrast against #0a0b0d is washed out on white; desktop darkens the same
//     way, and skipping this is what makes naive light themes look faded.
//
// There is deliberately no exported `theme` const. A default would let a screen
// keep rendering dark while compiling cleanly; without one, `tsc` names every
// call site that still needs the hook.
