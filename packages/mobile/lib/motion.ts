/**
 * The app's motion language, in one place.
 *
 * Two halves, deliberately:
 *
 *   - **Named durations** for the transitions specific to this app — a board row
 *     moving between sections, a banner arriving above a list, a paged question
 *     sliding out. Each is a number lifted from the screen that first needed it,
 *     so a change here is a visible decision rather than a drive-by edit.
 *   - **The ladders and hooks** — the duration/easing/press steps in `tokens.ts`
 *     plus the press and entrance hooks every shared control uses.
 *
 * Two rules decide everything here:
 *
 *   - **Fast for the frequent.** Anything the finger triggers repeatedly gets a
 *     ≤150ms transition on transform or opacity only, so it composites on the
 *     GPU and never delays the next tap.
 *   - **Motion is never the only signal.** Every animated state change in this
 *     app also changes color, an icon or a label, so the interface still reads
 *     with motion switched off — which is exactly what happens when the user has
 *     Reduce Motion on, where these helpers become no-ops.
 *
 * Free of React Native imports so the rules stay unit-testable under Node; the
 * hooks that need `Animated` live in motionHooks.ts, and the hook that reads the
 * OS setting lives in useReducedMotion.ts.
