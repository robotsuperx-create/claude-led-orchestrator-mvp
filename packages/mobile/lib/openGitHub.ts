/**
 * The in-app browser, when the build actually has it.
 *
 * `expo-web-browser` is a native module, and its package throws while it is
 * being imported if the runtime has no `ExpoWebBrowser` to bind to. That is not
 * hypothetical: the dependency arrived in a branch whose `Podfile.lock` was
 * never regenerated, so the module was in `node_modules` and absent from the
 * app, and every GitHub tap took the whole screen down with a red box.
 *
 * Requiring it here, inside the guard, means a build without the pod falls back
 * to the system browser instead — which is what this function did before the
 * in-app browser existed.

// Opens a github.com URL in the GitHub app when it's installed, and in the
// in-app browser otherwise (SFSafariViewController / Chrome Custom Tab, so the
// user never leaves AO). The app is preferred because it carries the user's
// session: a private repo or PR opened in a browser shows a login wall or a 404.
//
// Any web URL is accepted: for one the app has no screen for, this is just the
// in-app browser. If that refuses (on Android, nothing resolves the intent:
// `NoMatchingActivityException`) the system browser is the last hop, as it was
// before the in-app one existed. Every caller is a tap, so when nothing at all
// could open the link the tap says so with the error haptic rather than reading
// as a dead button. On iOS `canOpenURL` also needs "github" listed in
// LSApplicationQueriesSchemes (see app.json) or it always answers false.
//
// A URL that is not a web page can only be opened by the system: the iOS bug
// report arrives as `x-safari-https://` (see bugReportOpenUrl), which the
// in-app browser rejects.
//
// `fromSheet` skips the in-app browser. SFSafariViewController is presented on
// whatever is frontmost, and on top of a native formSheet that goes wrong both
// ways: dismissed later, it leaves the sheet full-height with no grabber; opened
// while the sheet is still dismissing, iOS drops the presentation silently and
// expo-web-browser answers every later call with "locked" until the app
// restarts. Leaving the app keeps the sheet untouched, exactly as it already is
// on a device with the GitHub app installed.
