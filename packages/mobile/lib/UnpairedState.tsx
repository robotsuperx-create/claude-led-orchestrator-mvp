/**
 * What every screen shows before a desktop has been paired.
 *
 * The three tabs each had their own answer to this: Workers explained what was
 * missing and offered the scanner, while Projects and PRs said "No server /
 * Connect to AO in Settings" with no way to act on it — and sent the user to
 * hunt through Settings for a field rather than to the scanner that fixes it.
 * PRs did not even render a header, so the tab lost its title at the one moment
 * a new user most needs to know where they are.
 *
 * This is the Workers copy, which was the good one, made shared. Deliberately
 * not a restatement of the welcome screen: someone reaching this has already
 * read that and chosen to move past it.
